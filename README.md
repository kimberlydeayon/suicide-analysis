Suicide Mortality Analysis: Explored global suicide trends using WHO data. Built an interactive dashboard with gender and country breakdowns, time-based animations, and custom filters. Focused on data cleaning, visualization, and public health insights using Python.
 Suicide Mortality Analysis
This project explores global suicide mortality trends using publicly available WHO data. The goal was to uncover patterns across countries, genders, and time periods, and present findings through an interactive dashboard.
Key Features:
• 	Cleaned and standardized real-world health data with inconsistent formats and naming conventions
• 	Built dynamic visualizations including geographic animations, time series plots, and filterable breakdowns
• 	Applied statistical techniques to identify high-risk regions and demographic disparities
• 	Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Jupyter Notebook for analysis and dashboard creation
• 	Emphasized ethical data handling and sensitivity in communicating public health insights
Outcome:
The final dashboard enables users to explore suicide mortality rates by country and gender over time, offering a tool for researchers, policymakers, and educators to better understand global mental health trends.
